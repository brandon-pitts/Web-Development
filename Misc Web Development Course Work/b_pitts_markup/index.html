        <p>My name is Brandon Pitts. I am an Information System major here at SUU. I work down in the IT Help Desk for the IT departmet. My passion is all things computer. I spent the majority of my time working or playing with or on my computer. I am in my last year of school and excited to start something new after graduation.</p>
        <p>I have some experience with the very basics of HTML and CSS but for the most part a lot of my knowledge comes from just playing with it. I love just working to figure things out on my own and a lot of my skills for my job have been developed this way. I am not the most artistic person on the planet but I do love the inner functions of the code. I am excited to learn more about the field within this class and I'm happy for the challenge.</p>

                <h3>Favorite TV Show</h3>
                <h4>M*A*S*H</h4>
                As far as I'm concerened MASH is the perfect sitcom. It is incredibly funny and can walk the line between funny and serious very well.

                <h3>Favorite Movies</h3>
                <h4>Favorite Movie 1: Blazing Saddles</h4>
                I enjoy Mel Brooks movies and find older style comedies very funny.
                <h4>Favorite Movie 2: Twister</h4>
                It is just a fantastic movie even if it didn't age well.
                <h4>Favorite Movie 3: Big Fish</h4>
                Far fetched and a little out there this movie is just fun and quirky.
