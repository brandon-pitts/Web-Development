        <p>Art Deco made its influence on painting while keeping its very luxurious themes. Most paintings in this style are intended as decoration, additions to already existing design spaces. A lot of the paintings done for Art Deco were murals painted on ceilings or large walls in some of the massive buildings constructed in the same style.

And so the galleries began to hang my work in their best rooms, always in the middle, because my painting was attractive. It was precise. It was â€˜finished.'"</q> ~ Tamara de Lempicka</blockquote>
