            <p>UX design focuses on the user experience. When designing for the user experience elements of psychology are just as important as those of design. How will users move through your design? Will users understand the things they need to understand? Is the focus of the site correctly perceived through the content layout and structure? All of these questions are answered through UX design and a firm understanding of how users think and use the web. Heuristic UX design allows the users to utilize the tools created for them with a level of freedom and control that increases their experience throughout the whole process.</p>

                <h2 class="number">1</h2>
                <h3 class="leftAlign">Visibility of Systems Status</h3>
                <p class="leftAlign leftP">Users must always be informed of what is happening in your design. Progress bars or status indicators provide feedback to the users so they know that something is happening. Without feedback a user might think something has frozen and either leave the system entirely or think it has broken. Through feedback you involve the user into the process, the system and the user work together on a task. Even if the task is simple, the user must be appropriately informed. </p>

            <div class="content2" data-aos="fade-right">
                <h2 class="number">2</h2>
                <h3 class="rightAlign">Match Between System and the Real World</h3>
                <p class="rightAlign rightP">All users are different. Creating a specific design for each and everyone of them is just not possible. However, a design must be flexible and allow for different languages and user experience levels. Supported languages must be clearly stated in an easily reachable location. The design should meet real-world conventions and be presented in a natural and logical manner.</p>

                <h2 class="number">3</h2>
                <h3 class="leftAlign">User Control and Freedom</h3>
                <p class="leftAlign leftP">Through design you are creating tools for the user. Functions must be clearly stated so the user knows what to expect. Users require a level of freedom when utilizing your tools you’ve given them. Allow for undoing or redoing, this gives them the freedom to make mistakes. Make your functions clearly stated in dialog so users do not panic and just look for the nearest exit.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content4" data-aos="fade-right">
                <h2 class="number">4</h2>
                <h3 class="rightAlign">Consistency and Standards</h3>
                <p class="rightAlign rightP">There must always be a firm level of consistency when creating a design. Users go into any situation with preconceived expectations of how your design is going to function. Your job is to anticipate these expectations and create an experience that meets them. You are not just working alone here, users come from other systems where standards might be one way or another. To allow for the best user experience your design must work with the users and not against them. Once you’ve decided upon a standard, stick with it.</p>

                <h3 class="leftAlign">Error Prevention</h3>
                <p class="leftAlign leftP">As a designer you must understand and anticipate the types of errors that your users might come across. Once you know what to expect you can then start to work with your users and avoid anything that might interrupt their experience. Make your design clear and concise to limit any user errors. Extra options might seem like a good idea at first but in the long run may cause for confusion leading to a user making an error.</p>

            <div  class="content6" data-aos="fade-right">
                <h2 class="number">6</h2>
                <h3 class="rightAlign">Recognition Rather than Recall</h3>
                <p class="rightAlign rightP">Allow users to see elements of your design and recognize their meaning. This will limit the need for users to remember certain aspects that might have been specific to this situation. Users have been conditioned to see elements and instantly know their meaning, rely on this and use it to your advantage. This will limit the need for loading information within the user’s own memory and streamline the process of using your design.</p>

                <h3 class="leftAlign">Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h3>
                <p class="leftAlign leftP">User interfaces are often a “one size fits all” concept through necessity. However, more often than not the users can range from beginners to experts when utilizing your designs. Allow your users the flexibility to use your creation their way. Provide advanced options but don’t overwhelm beginners with them. Allow customization in a way to assist the user to create their own experience.</p>

            <div  class="content8" data-aos="fade-right">
                <h2 class="number">8</h2>
                <h3 class="rightAlign">Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3>
                <p class="rightAlign rightP">Users should only be presented with information that is relevant to them. This includes dialog boxes, only expose the user to necessary information. The more information or clutter that is added to the already limited viewing space will diminish the importance of everything. Priorities must be considered when designing what must be shown rather than just showing everything.</p>

                <h2 class="number">9</h2>
                <h3 class="leftAlign">Help users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors</h3>
                <p class="leftAlign leftP">Errors happen, most users know this. A proper design should present errors with an appropriate amount of information about what happened to create it. With the right amount of information users can begin to diagnose what happened. Users should be given the tools to recover from any error they might come to.</p>

                <h3 class="rightAlign">Help and Documentation</h3>
                <p class="rightAlign rightP">In a perfect world, all systems would be able to be run without any external help but it is always good to provide it. Help and documentation can assist users in finding exactly what they need. This information should be easily searchable, have clear steps to be accomplished, and not be too long.</p>
